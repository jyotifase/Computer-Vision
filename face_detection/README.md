**Face Detection Algorithm Comparison using FastAPI**

This project aims to compare the performance of various face detection algorithms using FastAPI, a modern web framework for building APIs with Python.

Description
The project involves implementing and integrating different face detection algorithms such as Haar Cascades, HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients), and deep learning-based methods such as MTCNN, SSD (Single Shot Detector), ratina face detector, mediapipe and yunet into a FastAPI application. The application will allow users to upload an image and detect faces using the different algorithms.

The project will help in understanding the trade-offs between accuracy and speed for different face detection algorithms and how they can be integrated into a modern web framework such as FastAPI.

Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your machine. You can then install the required dependencies by running the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
To start the FastAPI application, run the following command:
python app.py
You can then visit http://localhost:8000/docs in your browser to access the Swagger UI documentation and test the API.
