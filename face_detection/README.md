The project aims to compare the performance of various face detection algorithms using FastAPI, a modern web framework for building APIs with Python. <br>
The project will involve implementing and integrating different face detection algorithms such as Haar Cascades, HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients), and deep learning-based methods such as MTCNN, SSD (Single Shot Detector), ratina face detector, mediapipe and yunet into a FastAPI application. <br>
The application will allow users to upload an image and detect faces using the different algorithms. <br>
The project will help in understanding the trade-offs between accuracy and speed for different face detection algorithms and how they can be integrated into a modern web framework such as FastAPI.
